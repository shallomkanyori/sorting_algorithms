## C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

####Task 0: Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
- Prototype: `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
- Youâ€™re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements
Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case
