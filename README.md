## C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

#### Task 0: Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
- Prototype: `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
- You’re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements
Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

#### Task 1: Insertion sort
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
- Prototype: `void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);`
- You are not allowed to modify the integer `n` of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves
- You’re expected to print the `list` after each time you swap two elements
Write in the file `1-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case
